# Design Detailed Document (DDD)

1. **Description**:
This project serves as a comprehensive overview of the skills, techniques, and concepts acquired throughout the semester in the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering course, with a particular emphasis on HTML and CSS. The website is built using two main files: index.html, which provides the core structure of the site and manages its layout and navigation, and style.css, which is responsible for all visual styling and design elements. Together, these files create a cohesive and functional personal website. The site is divided into several sections that present information about my academic background, personal information, and a dedicated section that highlights one of my hobbies, demonstrating both technical knowledge and creativity.

 3. **Problems during the development**:  
During the early stages of development, I encountered difficulties understanding how HTML and CSS interact with each other. In particular, I was unsure how to correctly connect the style.css file to the index.html file, which resulted in the webpage displaying without any styling. Initially, this was confusing and frustrating, as the layout did not appear as expected. After researching and reviewing examples, I discovered that the issue was related to the <link> tag within the <head> section of the HTML file. I learned that it is essential to provide the correct relative file path so that the browser can properly locate and apply the CSS file.

 4. **Conclusions**:  
Overall, this project has been a meaningful and rewarding learning experience that allowed me to practice and reinforce my understanding of HTML and CSS. By facing and overcoming various challenges during development, I was able to improve my problem-solving abilities and gain confidence in web development. As a result, I now have a stronger grasp of how to design and structure a well-organized website, as well as a better appreciation for the importance of proper file linking and styling techniques.
